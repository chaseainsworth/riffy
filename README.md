# My App Outline

1. App Summary - My app will tell a user if water is boiling when they input a specific temperature and pressure. The user will be allowed to enter temperature and pressure in several different units.

2. App Logic - My app will have a table with specific pressures and temperatures, and if water will boil at those metrics or not. If the app detects an input within the specified ranges, it will output that the water would boil. If on or both of the inputs are outside the ranges, it will output a message saying to either increase temp or lower the pressure.

3. Stretch Goal - I want to allow users to enter some other types of liquid besides water, such as liquid Oxygen, C02, Iron...
